> Pardon me, just learning the ropes.

This repo consists of various Rust learning projects. So far, the projects are:
- ❔**guessing-game**: This is a small loop that asks the user to guess a number between 1-100 and ends when they get it right, giving hints after each guess.
- 🎓 **learning-variables**: This is a small script that plays with various data types and arithmetic operations.
- ⚙️ **functions**: This project experiments with the capabilities of functions.
- 🌳 **branches**: This program experiments with various loops, conditions, and control flow. It even has a functioning shop!
- 📒 **ownership**: This experiments with passing values to different variables and scopes.
- ⚔️ **mini-rpg**: Experimenting with a very small text-based rpg game.
- 🏗️ **structures**: Learning how to build structures and implemantation types like *method* and *associated functions*.
- 🧮 **enums-and-patterns**
