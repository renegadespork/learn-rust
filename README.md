> Pardon me, just learning the ropes.

This repo consists of various Rust learning projects. So far, the projects are:
- **guessing-game**: This is a small loop that asks the user to guess a number between 1-100 and ends when they get it right, giving hints after each guess.
- **learning-variables**: This is a small script that plays with various data types and arithmetic operations.
