> Pardon me, just learning the ropes.

This repo consists of various Rust learning projects. So far, the projects are:
- **guessing-game**: This is a small loop that asks the user to guess a number between 1-100 and ends when they get it right, giving hints after each guess.
- **learning-variables**: This is a small script that plays with various data types and arithmetic operations.
- **functions**: This project experiments with the capabilities of functions.
- **branches**: This program experiments with various loops, conditions, and control flow. It even has a functioning shop!
